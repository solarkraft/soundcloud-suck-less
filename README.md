====================

A super hacky userscript to temporarly fix the soundcloud website until they finally do it themselves. 

In case you need help with installing: [Installing Greasemonkey Scripts - Userscript.org](http://userscripts.org:8080/about/installing)


### Before
The player is on the bottom (seriously, that's almost unusable) and the statusbar just looks horrible.

### After
The player is back on the top again where it belongs and a flat look has been applied to most of the items. Also the name has been collapsed again and the ad has been hiddenso it looks a lot more clean and professional overall.
