soundcloud-suck-less
====================

A super hacky userscript to temporarly fix the soundcloud website until they finally do it themselves. 

## Installation

First you need a Greasemonkey from the [Mozilla addon registry](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). 
Then [just click this link](https://github.com/netsurfer912/soundcloud-suck-less/raw/master/sc-suck-less.user.js) and a dialog should appear asking whether you want to install the userscript (why else youl you be here, duh). 
That's it! Just [visit Soundcloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) or reload a current tab and you should see the mess cleaned up. 

The same procedure should with [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), although I haven't tested it yet. 


### Before
The player is on the bottom (seriously, that's almost unusable) and the statusbar just looks horrible.

### After
The player is back on the top again where it belongs and a flat look has been applied to most of the items. Also the name has been collapsed again and the ad has been hiddenso it looks a lot more clean and professional overall.
